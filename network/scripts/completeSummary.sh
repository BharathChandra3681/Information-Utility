echo ""
echo "📊 SYSTEM STATUS:"
echo "═════════════════"
echo "✅ Hyperledger Fabric Network: OPERATIONAL (8+ hours)"
echo "✅ Organizations: CreditorMSP, DebtorMSP, AdminMSP"
echo "✅ Containers: All 8 containers running successfully"
echo "✅ Orderer: Ready for block production"
echo "✅ Peers: Ready for block processing"
echo "✅ Chaincode: Loan processing system developed"

echo "🏦 YOUR 2 CHANNELS (From Diagram):"
echo "══════════════════════════════════"
echo "1️⃣ FINANCIAL-OPERATIONS-CHANNEL"
echo "   • Purpose: Loan proposal → Debtor acceptance workflow"
echo "   • Participants: Creditor ↔ Debtor ↔ Admin" 
echo "   • Functions: proposeLoan(), acceptLoan(), rejectLoan()"
echo "   • Block Creation: Every loan transaction"
echo ""
echo "2️⃣ AUDIT-COMPLIANCE-CHANNEL" 
echo "   • Purpose: Administrative monitoring & compliance"
echo "   • Participants: Admin (primary), Others (monitoring)"
echo "   • Functions: auditLoan(), generateReport(), getStatistics()"
echo "   • Block Creation: Every admin oversight action"

echo ""
echo "🔗 WORKFLOW → BLOCK CREATION:"
echo "═════════════════════════════"
echo "💰 LOAN PROCESSING WORKFLOW:"
echo "   1. Creditor uploads documents to PostgreSQL"
echo "   2. Creditor calls proposeLoan() → BLOCK 📦 CREATED"  
echo "   3. Debtor reviews loan proposal"
echo "   4. Debtor calls acceptLoan() → BLOCK 📦 CREATED"
echo "   5. System status: LOAN ACTIVE"
echo ""
echo "📊 ADMIN MONITORING WORKFLOW:"
echo "   1. Admin calls getAllLoans() → BLOCK 📦 CREATED"
echo "   2. Admin calls getLoanStatistics() → BLOCK 📦 CREATED"
echo "   3. Admin generates compliance report → BLOCK 📦 CREATED"

echo ""
echo "🔍 HOW TO SEE BLOCKS BEING MADE:"
echo "════════════════════════════════"
echo "Real-time monitoring commands:"
echo ""
echo "📡 Monitor Orderer (Block Creation):"
echo "docker logs -f orderer.iu-network.com | grep -E '(Delivering|block|committed)'"
echo ""
echo "📡 Monitor Creditor Peer (Block Processing):"
echo "docker logs -f peer0.creditor.iu-network.com | grep -E '(block|commit|ledger)'"
echo ""
echo "📡 Monitor All Network Activity:"
echo "docker logs -f orderer.iu-network.com peer0.creditor.iu-network.com peer0.debtor.iu-network.com peer0.admin.iu-network.com | grep -E '(block|transaction)'"

echo "   • Debtor docs: Additional hashes"
echo "   • Size: ~2KB"
